The effects of a continual measurement of one angular-momentum component are introduced into the model, and its effects on quantum coherences are shown to degrade the quantum coherence effects.

	abstract = {The Dirac equation is a cornerstone in the history of physics, merging successfully quantum mechanics with special relativity, providing a natural description of the electron spin and predicting the existence of anti-matter. Furthermore, it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm, relativistic quantum mechanics, is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein's paradox and Zitterbewegung, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger. These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles, while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects. Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups, where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes. Here, we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion, which is set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the cross-over from relativistic to nonrelativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

For the case of a single qubit, we show that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all unital Markovian quantum dynamics, whereas a set of processes parametrized by one continuous parameter is needed in general.

of a large spin. In this paper, we extend the analogy further to
demonstrate geometric effects by performing rotations on the spin.
Such effects can be used to determine properties of the chain, such as
its length, in a robust manner. Alternatively, they can form the basis
of a spin network quantum computer. We demonstrate a universal set of
gates in such a system by both dynamical and geometrical means.},

	abstract = {Quantum information transfer is an important part of quantum information processing. Several proposals for quantum information transfer along linear arrays of nearest-neighbor coupled qubits or spins were made recently. Perfect transfer was shown to exist in two models with specifically designed strongly inhomogeneous couplings. We show that perfect transfer occurs in an entire class of chains, including systems whose nearest-neighbor couplings vary only weakly along the chain. The key to these observations is the {Jordan-Wigner} mapping of spins to noninteracting lattice fermions that display perfectly periodic dynamics if the single-particle energy spectrum is appropriate. After a half-period of that dynamics, any state is transformed into its mirror image with respect to the center of the chain. The absence of fermion interactions preserves these features at an arbitrary temperature and allows for the transfer of nontrivially entangled states of several spins or qubits.},

We show that its zero-point fluctuations limit the mass sensitivity, for attainable parameters, to about an electron mass. In contrast to the case of a classical cantilever, we find the mass sensitivity of the quantum mechanical cantilever is independent of its resonant frequency in a certain parameter regime at low temperatures. We then consider an optomechanical setup in which the cantilever is reflective and forms one end of a laser-driven {Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'erot} cavity. For a resonator finesse of 5 the mass sensitivity at T=0 is limited by cavity noise to about a quarter of a Dalton, but this setup has a more favorable temperature dependency at finite temperature, compared to the free cantilever.},

We compute the multigraded Poincare series for the algebra of G-invariant polynomial functions on the affine space of all Hermitian operators of trace 1. We check that this series is consistent with the list of invariants computed by Makhlin. By using the recent result of Augusiak et al., we show that the boundary of S decomposes naturally into two pieces. We prove that the part of this boundary which is contained in the relative interior of M is a smooth manifold.},

	doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.81.865},
	abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalismâentanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and SchrÃ¶dingerâwaited over 70 years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal formâthe bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

Moreover, in our proposal the superradiant phase transition for this model can be well controlled by the frequency of external magnetic flux when the superconducting charge qubits work at their optimal point, in which the qubits can be mostly immune from charge noise produced by uncontrollable charge fluctuations. Finally, we propose to observe this phase transition by detecting the intracavity intensity in terms of a heterodyne detector out of the cavity.},

For polaritons, charge neutrality prevents magnetic fields from providing a direct symmetry-breaking mechanism and, similar to the situation in ultracold atomic gases, an effective magnetic field has to be synthesized. We show that in the {circuit-QED} architecture, this can be achieved by inserting simple superconducting circuits into the resonator junctions. In the presence of such coupling elements, constant parallel magnetic and electric fields suffice to break time-reversal symmetry. We support these theoretical predictions with numerical simulations for realistic sample parameters, specify general conditions under which time reversal is broken, and discuss the application to chiral Fock-state transfer, an on-chip circulator, and tunable band structure for the Kagome lattice.},

Reductions in photocurrent noise greater than 60\% ({\textminus}4 dB) below the limit set by the vacuum fluctuations of the field are observed in a balanced homodyne detector. A quantitative comparison with theory suggests that the observed noise reductions result from a field that in the absence of avoidable linear attenuation would be squeezed more than tenfold. A degree of squeezing of approximately fivefold is inferred for the actual field emitted through one mirror of the optical parametric oscillator. An explicit demonstration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the electromagnetic field is made from the measurements, which show that the field state produced by the downconversion process is a state of minimum uncertainty.},

	abstract = {As a crystal is disordered, a point may be reached where the typical mean free path of phonons is so short that the wavelength and mean free path are no longer sharp concepts, and the textbook phonon-gas model for thermal conductivity breaks down. This paper proposes an alternate theory for the disordered regime, and the subsequent paper implements the theory for a realistic model of amorphous silicon. The idea is that the dominant scattering is correctly described by a harmonic Hamiltonian, which is, in principle, transformable into a one-body problem of decoupled oscillators. >From this the thermal conductivity can be exactly calculated by an analog of the {Kubo-Greenwood} formula for electrical conductivity of disordered metals. Anderson localization is correctly contained in this theory; localized states contribute no currents in harmonic approximation. What is required is an atomistic model with a large unit cell and periodic boundary conditions (to avoid undesired surface effects). The linear size of the model should be larger than the mean free paths of the dominant phonons. A Kubo formula and then a {Kubo-Greenwood-type} formula are derived for this problem. A ââmode diffusivityââ Di for the ith exact oscillator state is defined. The heat is carried by off-diagonal elements of the heat current operator, which have a nonzero contribution because the temperature gradient introduces nonzero off-diagonal elements of the density matrix ãaiÂ°ajã. An effort is made to interpret these results physically. Schemes for implementing this formalism are discussed.},

	abstract = {A statistical distinguishability based on relative entropy characterizes the fitness of quantum states for phase estimation. This criterion is employed in the context of a {Mach-Zehnder} interferometer and used to interpolate between two regimes of local and global phase distinguishability. The scaling of distinguishability in these regimes with photon number is explored for various quantum states. It emerges that local distinguishability is dependent on a discrepancy between quantum and classical rotational energy. Our analysis demonstrates that the Heisenberg limit is the true upper limit for local phase sensitivity. Only the {{\textquotedblleft}NOON{\textquotedblleft}} states share this bound, but other states exhibit a better trade-off when comparing local and global phase regimes.},

However, the proof based on the general principle of complementarity of quantum mechanics applies to any scheme of phase measurement. From the general argument by the complementarity principle, we are able to find a necessary condition for those states that can achieve the Heisenberg limit if they are employed for precision phase measurement. A general guideline is given for the search of the measurement schemes in which the Heisenberg limit is achieved. We demonstrate the procedure by applying it to a few specific examples.},

So far, most of the important quantum information experiments are done with such states, including bright Gaussian light and weak Gaussian light. Extending the existing results of quantum information with discrete quantum states to the case of continuous variable quantum states is an interesting theoretical job. The quantum Gaussian states play a central role in such a case. We review the properties and applications of Gaussian states in quantum information with emphasis on the fundamental concepts, the calculation techniques and the effects of imperfections of the real-life experimental setups. Topics here include the elementary properties of Gaussian states and relevant quantum information device, entanglement-based quantum tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography with weak and strong Gaussian states and the quantum channel capacity, mathematical theory of quantum entanglement and state estimation for Gaussian states.},

Our studies are motivated by recent experiments and theoretical investigations on quantum dots and neutral atoms in microtraps as tools for quantum information processing. We present analogies between distinguishable particles, bosons, and fermions in low-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We introduce the notion of Slater rank for pure states of pairs of fermions and bosons in analogy to the Schmidt rank for pairs of distinguishable particles. This concept is generalized to mixed states and provides a correlation measure for indistinguishable particles. Then we generalize these notions to pure fermionic and bosonic states in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and also to the multi-particle case. We review the results on quantum correlations in mixed fermionic states and discuss the concept of fermionic Slater witnesses. Then the theory of quantum correlations in mixed bosonic states and of bosonic Slater witnesses is formulated. In both cases we provide methods of constructing optimal Slater witnesses that detect the degree of quantum correlations in mixed fermionic and bosonic states. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The zero and finite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermion, and boson model systems are discussed. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. In equilibrium entanglement is shown tightly connected to the characteristics of the phase diagram. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test.

  abstract = {We present the theory of how to achieve phase measurements with the
	minimum possible variance in ways that are readily implementable
	with current experimental techniques. Measurements whose statistics
	have high-frequency fringes, such as those obtained from maximally
	path-entangled (|N,0+|0,N)/ (?NOON?) states, have commensurately
	high information yield (as quantified by the Fisher information).
	However, this information is also highly ambiguous because it does
	not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes.
	We provide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly
	efficient way, providing phase estimates with uncertainty that is
	within a small constant factor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum
	allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. These techniques apply
	to NOON state and multipass interferometry, as well as phase measurements
	in quantum computing. We have reported the experimental implementation
	of some of these schemes with multipass interferometry elsewhere.
	Here, we present the theoretical foundation and also present some
	additional experimental results. There are three key innovations
	to the theory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase
	properties of the sequence of states (in multiple time modes) via
	the equivalent two-mode state. Second, we identify the key feature
	of the equivalent state that enables the optimal scaling of the intrinsic
	phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables us to identify appropriate
	combinations of states to use. The remaining difficulty is that the
	ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinsic phase uncertainty
	are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to solve
	this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate
	the optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved.
	We consider both adaptive and nonadaptive measurement schemes.},

  title = {{On the measurement of a weak classical force coupled to a quantum-mechanical
	oscillator. I. Issues of principle}},

  abstract = {The monitoring of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator on which
	a classical force acts is important in a variety of high-precision
	experiments, such as the attempt to detect gravitational radiation.
	This paper reviews the standard techniques for monitoring the oscillator,
	and introduces a new technique which, in principle, can determine
	the details of the force with arbitrary accuracy, despite the quantum
	properties of the oscillator. The standard method for monitoring
	the oscillator is the "amplitude-and-phase" method (position or momentum
	transducer with output fed through a narrow-band amplifier). The
	accuracy obtainable by this method is limited by the uncertainty
	principle ("standard quantum limit"). To do better requires a measurement
	of the type which Braginsky has called "quantum nondemolition." A
	well known quantum nondemolition technique is "quantum counting,"
	which can detect an arbitrarily weak classical force, but which cannot
	provide good accuracy in determining its precise time dependence.
	This paper considers extensively a new type of quantum nondemolition
	measurement-a "back-action-evading" measurement of the real part
	X1 (or the imaginary part X2) of the oscillator's complex amplitude.
	In principle X1 can be measured "arbitrarily quickly and arbitrarily
	accurately," and a sequence of such measurements can lead to an arbitrarily
	accurate monitoring of the classical force. The authors describe
	explicit Gedanken experiments which demonstrate that X1 can be measured
	arbitrarily quickly and arbitrarily accurately. In these experiments
	the measuring apparatus must be coupled to both the position (position
	transducer) and the momentum (momentum transducer) of the oscillator,
	and both couplings must be modulated sinusoidally. For a given measurement
	time the strength of the coupling determines the accuracy of the
	measurement; for arbitrarily strong coupling the measurement can
	be arbitrarily accurate. The "momentum transducer" is constructed
	by combining a "velocity transducer" with a "negative capacitor"
	or "negative spring." The modulated couplings are provided by an
	external, classical generator, which can be realized as a harmonic
	oscillator excited in an arbitrarily energetic, coherent state. One
	can avoid the use of two transducers by making "stroboscopic measurements"
	of X1, in which one measures position (or momentum) at half-cycle
	intervals. Alternatively, one can make "continuous single-transducer"
	measurements of X1 by modulating appropriately the output of a single
	transducer (position or momentum), and then filtering the output
	to pick out the information about X1 and reject information about
	X2. Continuous single-transducer measurements are useful in the case
	of weak coupling. In this case long measurement times are required
	to achieve good accuracy, and continuous single-transducer measurements
	are almost as good as perfectly coupled two-transducer measurements.
	Finally, the authors develop a theory of quantum nondemolition measurement
	for arbitrary systems. This paper (Paper I) concentrates on issues
	of principle; a sequel (Paper II) will consider issues of practice.},

Increasing the amplitude of an unknown quantum optical field, or any harmonic oscillator state, must introduce noise. This linear amplification noise prevents perfect copying of the quantum state, enforces quantum limits on communications and metrology, and is the mechanism preventing the increase of entanglement via local operations. Non-deterministic versions of ideal cloning and local entanglement increase (distillation) are allowed, suggesting the possibility of non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. Here we introduce, and experimentally demonstrate, such a noiseless linear amplifier for quantum states of the optical field, and use it for distillation of field-mode entanglement. This simple but powerful circuit enables practical devices for enhancing quantum technologies. The idea of noiseless amplification unifies approaches to cloning and distillation, and will find applications in quantum metrology and communications.},

Heralded photon addition or subtraction is, as a matter of fact, at the heart of continuous-variable entanglement distillation. The use of such processes has recently been experimentally demonstrated in the context of the generation of optical coherent-state superpositions or the verification of canonical commutation relations. Here, we carry out a systematic study of the effect of local photon additions and subtractions on a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, showing that the entanglement generally increases with the number of such operations. This is analytically proven when additions or subtractions are restricted to one mode only, while we observe that the highest entanglement is achieved when these operations are equally shared between the two modes. We also note that adding photons typically provides a stronger entanglement enhancement than subtracting photons, while photon subtraction performs better in terms of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between entanglement and non-Gaussianity, showing that it is more subtle than previously expected.},

	abstract = {Subtracting photons from a two-mode squeezed state is a well-known method to increase entanglement. We analyze different strategies of local photon subtraction from a two-mode squeezed state in terms of entanglement gain and success probability. We develop a general framework that incorporates imperfections and losses in all stages of the process: before, during, and after subtraction. By combining all three effects into a single efficiency parameter, we provide analytical and numerical results for subtraction strategies using photon-number-resolving and threshold detectors. We compare the entanglement gain afforded by symmetric and asymmetric subtraction scenarios across the two modes. For a given amount of loss, we identify an optimized set of parameters, such as initial squeezing and subtraction beam splitter transmissivity, that maximize the entanglement gain rate. We identify regimes for which asymmetric subtraction of different Fock states on the two modes outperforms symmetric strategies. In the lossless limit, subtracting a single photon from one mode always produces the highest entanglement gain rate. In the lossy case, the optimal strategy depends strongly on the losses on each mode individually, such that there is no general optimal strategy. Rather, taking losses on each mode as the only input parameters, we can identify the optimal subtraction strategy and required beam splitter transmissivities and initial squeezing parameter. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the distillation of continuous-variable quantum entanglement.},

This is true both for continuous-variable as well as discrete variable systems in odd prime dimensions, two cases which will be treated on entirely the same footing. Noting the fact that Clifford and Gaussian operations preserve the positivity of the Wigner function, our result generalizes the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Our algorithm provides a way of sampling from the output distribution of a computation or a simulation, including the efficient sampling from an approximate output distribution in the case of sampling imperfections for initial states, gates, or measurements. In this sense, this work highlights the role of the positive Wigner function as separating classically efficiently simulable systems from those that are potentially universal for quantum computing and simulation, and it emphasizes the role of negativity of the Wigner function as a computational resource.},

In both types of reservoir models moderate non-Markovian effects prolong the separability time scales. However, in these models the properties of the stationary state may differ. In the two-reservoir model the initial entanglement is completely lost and both modes are finally uncorrelated. In a common reservoir both modes interact indirectly via the coupling to the same bath variables. Below a critical bath temperature entanglement between the two modes is preserved even in the steady state. A separability criterion is derived, which depends on the bath temperature and the response function of the open quantum system.

We invoke an N-mode unitary transformation of the position and momentum operators and find that in the transformed basis the system is represented by a set of independent harmonic oscillators with only one of them coupled to the environment. Working in the Wigner representation of the density operator, we find that the covariance matrix has a block diagonal form that can be expressed in terms of multiples of 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 matrices. This simple property allows us to treat the problem to some extent analytically. We illustrate the advantage of working in the transformed basis using a simple example of three harmonic oscillators and find that the entanglement can persist for long times due to the presence of constants of motion for the covariance matrix elements. We find that, in contrast to what one would expect, a strong damping of the oscillators leads to a better stationary entanglement than in the case of a weak damping.},

He studied with Niels Bohr, taught Richard Feynman, and boned up on relativity with his friend and colleague Albert Einstein. John Archibald Wheeler's fascinating life brings us face to face with the central characters and discoveries of modern physics. He was the first American to learn of the discovery of nuclear fission, later coined the term "black hole," led a renaissance in gravitation physics, and helped to build Princeton University into a mecca for physicists. From nuclear physics, to quantum theory, to relativity and gravitation, Wheeler's work has set the trajectory of research for half a century. His career has brought him into contact with the most brilliant minds of his field; Fermi, Bethe, Rabi, Teller, Oppenheimer, and Wigner are among those he called colleagues and friends. In this rich autobiography, Wheeler reveals in fascinating detail the excitement of each discovery, the character of each colleague, and the underlying passion for knowledge that drives him still.

	abstract = {Spacetime is expected to have a âfoamlikeâ structure on scales of the Planck length or less with high curvatures and complicated topology. This foam can be thought of as being built out of three basic kinds of units or âgravitational bubblesâ, {CP}2, S2 Ã S2 and K3. We investigate the propagation of particles in simple models of the first two types of bubble. The non-trivial topologies of the bubbles introduce extra singularities into the Green functions. These make large contributions to the S-matrix for scalar particles but only small contributions for spin-12 or 1 particles at energies small compared to the Planck length. These results suggest that there is no inconsistency between the spacetime foam picture and everyday observations from which spacetime appears nearly flat, because all the elementary particles we have observed have spin 12 or greater. They do, however, suggest that Higgs scalar fields, if they exist at all, are probably bound states of higher spin particles rather than being elementary fields. Further developments may enable one to calculate processes in which quantum coherence is lost and intrinsic entropy is produced.},

This limitation to space-time measurements is interpreted as resulting from quantum fluctuations of space-time itself. Thus, at very short distance scales, space-time is âfoamy.â This intrinsic foaminess of space-time provides another source of noise in the interferometers. The {LIGO}/{VIRGO} and {LISA} generations of gravity-wave interferometers, through future refinements, are expected to reach displacement noise levels low enough to test our proposed degree of foaminess in the structure of space-time.},

	abstract = {Nearly all theoretical approaches to the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity predict1, 2, 3, 4 that, at very short distance scales, the classical picture of space-time breaks down, with space-time becoming somewhat 'fuzzy' (or 'foamy'). The properties of this fuzziness and the length scale that characterizes itsonset are potentially a means for determining which (if any) of the existing models of quantum gravity is correct. But it is generally believed5 that these quantum space-time effects are too small to be probed by technologies currently available. Here Iargue that modern gravity-wave interferometers are sensitive enough to test certain space-time fuzziness models, because quantum space-time effects should provide an additional source of noise in the interferometers that can be tightly constrained experimentally. The noise levels recently achieved in one interferometer6 are sufficient to rule out values of the length scale that characterizes one of the space-time fuzziness models down to the Planck length (10-35 m) and beyond, while the sensitivity required to test another model should be achievable with interferometers now under construction.},

Applications of great technological relevance lie in the precise measurement of parameters which play a central role in relativity, such as proper accelerations, relative distances, time and gravitational field strengths. In this paper we generalize recently introduced techniques to estimate physical quantities within quantum field theory in flat and curved space-time. We consider a bosonic quantum field that undergoes a generic transformation, which encodes the parameter to be estimated. We present analytical formulas for optimal precision bounds on the estimation of small parameters in terms of Bogoliubov coefficients for single-mode and two-mode Gaussian channels.},

Four key examples are given, describing quantum limited estimation for: acceleration, black holes, gravitational waves and cosmology.

Quantum metrology has been so far successfully applied to design precision instruments such as clocks and sensors which outperform classical devices by exploiting quantum properties. There are advanced plans to implement these and other quantum technologies in space, for instance Space-{QUEST} and Space Optical Clock projects intend to implement quantum communications and quantum clocks at regimes where relativity starts to kick in. However, typical setups do not take into account the effects of relativity on quantum properties. To include and exploit these effects, we introduce techniques for the application of metrology to quantum field theory. Quantum field theory properly incorporates quantum theory and relativity, in particular, at regimes where space-based experiments take place. This framework allows for high precision estimation of parameters that appear in quantum field theory including proper times and accelerations. Indeed, the techniques can be applied to develop a novel generation of relativistic quantum technologies for gravimeters, clocks and sensors. As an example, we present a high precision device which in principle improves the state-of-the-art in quantum accelerometers by exploiting relativistic effects.},

The conformal nature of the projection, preserving shapes locally, may be of particular use for analyzing large-scale structure. Prominent in the map is a Sloan Great Wall of galaxies 1.37 billion light-years long, 80\% longer than the Great Wall discovered by Geller and Huchra and therefore the largest observed structure in the universe.},

We construct an explicit realization by treating photon propagation through quantum excitations of D-brane fluctuations in the space-time foam. These are described by higher-genus string effects, that lead to stochastic fluctuations in couplings, and hence in the velocity of light. We discuss the possibilities of constraining or measuring photon diffusion in vacuo via Î³-ray observations of distant astrophysical sources.},

These metric fluctuations will introduce fluctuations of the light cone. It is shown that when the various two-point functions of a quantized field are averaged over the metric fluctuations, the light cone singularity disappears for distinct points. The metric-averaged functions remain singular in the limit of coincident points. The metric-averaged retarded Greenâs function for a massless field becomes a Gaussian which is nonzero both inside and outside of the classical light cone. This implies some photons propagate faster than the classical light speed, whereas others propagate slower. The possible effects of metric fluctuations upon one-loop quantum processes are discussed and illustrated by the calculation of the one-loop electron self-energy.},

	abstract = {In The Quantum Theory of Fields, Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg combines his exceptional physical insight with his gift for clear exposition to provide a self-contained, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction to quantum field theory.         This is a two-volume work.  Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before, and emphasizing the reasons why such a theory should describe nature.  After a brief historical outline, the book begins anew with the principles about which we are most certain, relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow from these principles.  Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence.   The author presents the classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. His account of renormalization theory reflects the changes in our view of quantum field theory since the advent of effective field theories.    The book's scope extends beyond quantum electrodynamics to elementary particle physics, and nuclear physics.  It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Problems are included at the end of each chapter.   This work will be an invaluable reference for all physicists and mathematicians who use quantum field theory, and it is also appropriate as a textbook for graduate students in this area.},

Also discussed are how measurements based on the exchange of electromagnetic signals of distances, velocities, etc. of moving objects are influenced. As an application, orders of magnitude of such effects are compared with the scale set by the apparently anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts, which is 10â9m/s2. There is no reason to believe that the latter is of cosmological origin. However, the general problem of gaining a qualitative and quantitative understanding of how the cosmological dynamics influences local systems remains challenging, with only partial clues being so far provided by exact solutions to the field equations of general relativity.},

	abstract = {The post-Newtonian theory of motion of celestial bodies and propagation of light was instrumental in conducting the critical experimental tests of general relativity and in building the astronomical ephemerides of celestial bodies in the Solar System with unparalleled precision. The cornerstone of the theory is the postulate that the Solar System is gravitationally isolated from the rest of the Universe and the background spacetime is asymptotically flat. The present article extends this theoretical concept and formulates the principles of celestial dynamics of particles and light moving in the gravitational field of a localized astronomical system embedded to the expanding Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker universe. We formulate the precise mathematical concept of the Newtonian limit of Einsteinâs field equations in the conformally flat Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime and analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles and light in this limit. We prove that by doing conformal spacetime transformations, one can reduce the equations of motion of particles and light to the classical form of the Newtonian theory. However, the time arguments in the equations of motion of particles and light differ from each other in terms being proportional to the Hubble constant H. This leads to the important conclusion that the equations of light propagation used currently by space navigation centers for fitting range and Doppler-tracking observations of celestial bodies are missing some terms of the cosmological origin that are proportional to the Hubble constant H. We also analyze the effect of the cosmological expansion on motion of electrons in atoms. We prove that the Hubble expansion does not affect the atomic frequencies and hence does not affect the atomic time scale used in the creation of astronomical ephemerides. We derive the cosmological correction to the light travel time equation and argue that its measurement opens an exciting opportunity to determine the local value of the Hubble constant H in the Solar System independently of cosmological observations.},

A model of Quantum Spacetime is then discussed where the commutation relations exactly implement our uncertainty relations. We outline the definition of free fields and interactions over {QST} and take the first steps to adapting the usual perturbation theory. The quantum nature of the underlying spacetime replaces a local interaction by a specific nonlocal effective interaction in the ordinary Minkowski space. A detailed study of interacting {QFT} and of the smoothing of ultraviolet divergences is deferred to a subsequent paper. In the classical limit where the Planck length goes to zero, our Quantum Spacetime reduces to the ordinary Minkowski space times a two component space whose components are homeomorphic to the tangent {bundleTS} 2 of the 2-sphere. The relations with Conne's theory of the standard model will be studied elsewhere.},

	abstract = {We study the cosmological evolution of frequency of a standing electromagnetic wave in a resonant optical cavity placed to the expanding manifold described by the RobertsonâWalker metric. Because of the Einstein principle of equivalence ({EEP}), one can find a local coordinate system (a local freely falling frame), in which spacetime is locally Minkowskian. However, due to the conformal nature of the RobertsonâWalker metric the conventional transformation to the local inertial coordinates introduces ambiguity in the physical interpretation of the local time coordinate, X0X{\textasciicircum}0 . Therefore, contrary to a common-sense expectation, a straightforward implementation of {EEP} alone does not allow us to unambiguously decide whether atomic clocks based on quantum transitions of atoms, ticks at the same rate as the clocks based on electromagnetic modes of a cavity. To resolve this ambiguity we have to analyse the cavity rigidity and the oscillation of its electromagnetic modes in an expanding universe by employing the full machinery of the Maxwell equations irrespectively of the underlying theory of gravity. We proceed in this way and found out that the size of the cavity and the electromagnetic frequency experience an adiabatic drift in conformal (unphysical) coordinates as the universe expands in accordance with the Hubble law. We set up the oscillation equation for the resonant electromagnetic modes, solve it by the {WKB} approximation, and reduce the coordinate-dependent quantities to their counterparts measured by a local observer who counts time with atomic clock. The solution shows that there is a perfect mutual cancellation of the adiabatic drift of cavityâs frequency by space transformation to local coordinates and the time counted by the clocks based on electromagnetic modes of cavity has the same rate as that of atomic clocks. We conclude that if general relativity is correct and the local expansion of space is isotropic there should be no cosmological drift of frequency of a standing electromagnetic wave oscillating in the cavity resonator as compared to the frequency of atomic clocks. Continuous comparison of the frequency of the optical cavity resonator against that of atomic clock yields a powerful null test of the local isotropy of the Hubble expansion and the Einstein equivalence principle in cosmology.},

	abstract = {We develop a formulation of quantum damping theory in which the explicit nature of inputs from a heat bath, and of outputs into it, is taken into account. Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of ââquantum white noiseââ is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDEâs) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDEâs: the Ito and the Stratonovich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDEâs developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},

An extension of the theory to include mechanical light effects and a generalization to atomic systems with Zeeman substructure are given.

	abstract = {A fully quantum-mechanical treatment of resonant light scattering is presented. The incident field is assumed to be described by a coherent state, and is allowed to be intense enough to cause saturation. Complete solutions are obtained for the correlated atom-field pure state vector, including multiphoton contributions of arbitrary order. The frequency spectrum of the scattered field is evaluated and is found to agree exactly with the result previously obtained by means of the quantum fluctuation-regression theorem. A derivation of the fluctuation-regression theorem and of the optical Bloch equations is given which is fully quantum mechanical and which relies upon no assumption of statistical factorization of atom and field states. The accuracy of the result found for the scattered - field spectrum is thus shown to be limited only by the assumption of the smallness of the saturated linewidth compared to the (optical) atomic resonance frequency. The one-photon approximation is analyzed in some detail. The method of adding an imaginary term to the upper-atomic-state energy is clarified, and it is shown how the vacuum and one-photon amplitudes thereby obtained may be used, within a simple and plausible iteration scheme, to construct the complete multiphoton spectrum. A variety of commonly used injection schemes and methods of representing atomic relaxation are discussed, and comparisons are made with results found by other authors. The entire analysis is performed with the aid of a canonical transformation which replaces the applied field by a c number. It is thus proved quite rigorously and generally that the use of a c-number applied field is a fully quantum-mechanical procedure, provided only that radiation-reaction terms are retained.},

	abstract = {Non-equilibrium quantum dynamics represents an emerging paradigm for condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and statistical mechanics. Strongly interacting Rydberg atoms offer an attractive platform to study driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum spin models with long-range order. Here, we explore the conditions under which stationary many-body entanglement persists with near-unit fidelity and high scalability. In our approach, coherent many-body dynamics is driven by Rydberg-mediated laser transitions, while atoms at the lattice boundary reduce the entropy of the many-body state. Surprisingly, the many-body entanglement is established by continuously evolving a locally dissipative Rydberg system towards the steady-state, as with optical pumping. We characterize the dynamics of multipartite entanglement in a 1D lattice by way of quantum uncertainty relations, and demonstrate the long-range behavior of the stationary entanglement with finite-size scaling, reaching "hectapartite" entanglement under experimental conditions. Our work opens a route towards dissipative preparation of many-body entanglement with unprecedented scaling behavior.},

to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of noisy measurements
by measuring identically prepared systems N
times and averaging the measurement results. This leads
to a scaling of the sensitivity as 1/âN, known in quantum
measurement theory as the âstandard quantum limitâ
(SQL). It is known that if one puts the N systems into an
entangled state, a scaling as 1/N can be achieved, the socalled
âHeisenberg limitâ (HL), but decoherence problems
have so far prevented implementation of such protocols
for large N. Here we show that a method of coherent averaging
inspired by a recent entanglement-free quantum
enhanced measurement protocol is capable of achieving a
sensitivity that scales as 1/N in a purely classical setup.
This may substantially improve the measurement of very
weak interactions in the classical realm, and, in particular,
open a novel route to measuring the gravitational constant
with enhanced precision.},

The motion of the observer leads on the one hand to a more complex signal due to a pixel-dependent Doppler shift that is neglected in the standard derivation of the Van Cittert--Zernike theorem, but on the other hand one may hope that it could be employed for a temporal aperture synthesis, where virtual baselines are created through the motion of the satellite.

Our derivation is based on first principles, starting with the wave propagation in the Earth reference frame of electro-magnetic fields arising from incoherent current sources, and Lorentz transforming the fields into the reference frame of the satellite. Our detailed study leads to the remarkable conclusion that the delay time due to observer motion cancels exactly the Doppler effect.

However, the angular resolution can be improved by means of aperture synthesis interferometric techniques. A narrow beam is synthesized during the image formation processing of the cross-correlations measured at zero-lag between pairs of signals collected by an array of antennas. The angular resolution is then determined by the maximum antenna spacing normalized to the wavelength (baseline). The next step in improving the angular resolution is the Doppler-Radiometer, somehow related to the super-synthesis radiometers and the Radiometer-SAR. This paper presents the concept of a three-antenna Doppler-Radiometer for 2D imaging. The performance of this instrument is evaluated in terms of angular/spatial resolution and radiometric sensitivity, and an L-band illustrative example is presented},

Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of a four-qubit polarization bound-entangled state, the so-called Smolin state. We have fully characterized its entanglement properties. Moreover, we have realized unlocking of the entanglement protocol for this state.

This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.},

The states in the class are maximally entangled in the sense that their average bipartite entanglement with respect to all possible bipartite cuts is maximal. We show that while all the states in the class maximize the average tangle, there are only a few states in the class that maximize the average Tsillas or Renyi ÃÂ±-entropy of entanglement. Quite remarkably, we find that up to local unitaries, there exists two unique states, one maximizing the average ÃÂ±-Tsallis entropy of entanglement for all ÃÂ± Ã¢Â©Â¾ 2, while the other maximizing it for all 0 \&lt; ÃÂ± Ã¢Â©Â½ 2 (including the von-Neumann case of ÃÂ± = 1). Furthermore, among the maximally entangled four qubits states, there are only three maximally entangled states that have the property that for two, out of the three bipartite cuts consisting of two-qubits verses two-qubits, the entanglement is 2 ebits and for the remaining bipartite cut the entanglement between the two groups of two qubits is 1 ebit. The unique three maximally entangled states are the three cluster states that are related by a swap operator.

	abstract = {From both theoretical and experimental points of view symmetric states constitute an important class of multipartite states. Still, entanglement properties of these states, in particular those with positive partial transposition (PPT), lack a systematic study. Aiming at filling in this gap, we have recently affirmatively answered the open question of existence of four-qubit entangled symmetric states with PPT and thoroughly characterized entanglement properties of such states [J. Tura et al., Phys. Rev. A 85, 060302(R) (2012)]. With the present contribution we continue on characterizing PPT entangled symmetric states. On the one hand, we present all the results of our previous work in a detailed way. On the other hand, we generalize them to systems consisting of an arbitrary number of qubits. In particular, we provide criteria for separability of such states formulated in terms of their ranks. Interestingly, for most of the cases, the symmetric states are either separable or typically separable. Then, edge states in these systems are studied, showing in particular that to characterize generic PPT entangled states with four and five qubits, it is enough to study only those that assume few (respectively, two and three) specific configurations of ranks. Finally, we numerically search for extremal PPT entangled states in such systems consisting of up to 23 qubits. One can clearly notice regularity behind the ranks of such extremal states, and, in particular, for systems composed of odd numbers of qubits we find a single configuration of ranks for which there are extremal states.},

It determines the metric of flat space-time, presents an upper bound to the speed of all matter and information with respect to any inertial reference frame in the Universe, and plays a crucial role for applications such as satellite-based navigation systems. Its value is fixed by convention to the value \$c=299 792 458\$ m/s. However, advanced theories predict possible deviations from this universal value, or even quantum fluctuations of \$c\$. Combining arguments from quantum parameter estimation theory and general relativity, we here establish rigorously the existence of lower bounds on the precision to which the speed of light can be determined \$in\$ \$principle\$.},

We use quantum Fisher information as a measure of the accuracy of estimation to compare protocols which use collections of qubits in product states to one in which the qubits are in a correlated state. We show that, for certain parameter values and initial states, the correlated state protocol can yield a greater accuracy per channel invocation than the product state protocols. We show that, for some parameters and initial states, using more than two qubits and channel invocations is advantageous. These results stand in contrast to the known optimal case that uses pure initial states and a single channel invocation on a pair of entangled qubits.},

This comparison includes cases where the ancilla is itself depolarizing and where the probe is circulated back through the channel before measurement. Compared on the basis of (quantum Fisher) information gained per channel use, we find broadly that entanglement with an ancilla dominates the other two schemes, but only if entanglement is cheap relative to the cost per channel use and only if the external ancilla is well shielded from depolarization. We arrive at these results by a relatively simple analytical means. A separate, more complicated analysis for partially entangled probes shows for the qudit depolarizing channel that any amount of probe entanglement is advantageous and that the greatest advantage comes with maximal entanglement.},

The channel directions are defined as the contracting directions of the channel with an arbitrary fixed basis of Pauli- matrices. In the qubit Pauli channel case with known channel directions it is shown that the optimal configuration that maximizes the Fisher information of the estimated parameters consists of three von Neumann measurements together with pure input states directed to the appropriate channel directions. Extensions of these results for generalized Pauli channels are also given. Furthermore, a computationally efficient estimation method is proposed for estimating the channel directions in the qubit Pauli channel case. The efficiency of this method is illustrated by simulations: it is shown that its variance is of order 1/N, where N is the number of used measurements.},

	abstract = {We investigate the performance of entangled coherent states for quantum-enhanced phase estimation. An exact analytical expression of quantum Fisher information is derived to show the role of photon losses on the ultimate phase sensitivity. We find a transition of the sensitivity from the Heisenberg scaling to the classical scaling due to quantum decoherence of the photon state. This quantum-classical transition is uniquely determined by the number of photons being lost, instead of the number of incident photons or the photon loss rate alone. Our results also reveal that a crossover of the sensitivity between the entangled coherent state and the NOON state can occur even for very small photon loss rate.},

	Abstract = {We summarize important recent advances in quantum metrology, in connection to experiments in cold gases, trapped cold atoms and photons. First we review simple metrological setups, such as quantum metrology with spin squeezed states, with Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger states, Dicke states and singlet states. We calculate the highest precision achievable in these schemes. Then, we present the fundamental notions of quantum metrology, such as shot-noise scaling, Heisenberg scaling, the quantum Fisher information and the Cram{\'e}r--Rao bound. Using these, we demonstrate that entanglement is needed to surpass the shot-noise scaling in very general metrological tasks with a linear interferometer. We discuss some applications of the quantum Fisher information, such as how it can be used to obtain a criterion for a quantum state to be a macroscopic superposition. We show how it is related to the speed of a quantum evolution, and how it appears in the theory of the quantum Zeno effect. Finally, we explain how uncorrelated noise limits the highest achievable precision in very general metrological tasks. This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to `50 years of Bell's theorem'.},

	abstract = {The study of monotone inner products under stochastic mappings on the space of matrices was initiated by Morozova and Chentsov, motivated by information geometry. They did not show a monotone metric, but proposed several candidates. The main result of the present paper is to provide an abundance of monotone metrics by means of operator monotone functions and to characterize them. It turns out that there is a correspondence between monotone metrics and operator means in the sense of Kubo and Ando. It follows that all proposals of Morozova and Chentsov are indeed monotone metrics.},

	abstract = {Quantum technologies exploit entanglement to revolutionize computing, measurement, and communication. This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping, controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and illustrate successful theoretical proposals and experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.},

It can be used as a measure of the quantumness of correlations. Separability of the density matrix describing a pair of systems does not guarantee vanishing of the discord, thus showing that absence of entanglement does not imply classicality. We relate this to the quantum superposition principle, and consider the vanishing of discord as a criterion for the preferred effectively classical states of a system, i.e., the pointer states.},

@article{Modi2012,
	Abstract = {One of the best signatures of nonclassicality in a quantum system is the existence of correlations that have no classical counterpart. Different methods for quantifying the quantum and classical parts of correlations are among the more actively studied topics of quantum-information theory over the past decade. Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many cases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing quantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between the quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states. Here different notions of classical and quantum correlations quantified by quantum discord and other related measures are reviewed. In the first half, the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations are reviewed, related to each other, and the classical-quantum division that is common among them is discussed. In the second half, it is shown that the measures identify and quantify the deviation from classicality in various quantum-information-processing tasks, quantum thermodynamics, open-system dynamics, and many-body physics. It is shown that in many cases quantum correlations indicate an advantage of quantum methods over classical ones.},

	Abstract = {A quantum illumination protocol exploits correlated light beams to enhance the probability of detection of a partially reflecting object lying in a very noisy background. Recently a simple photon-number-detection-based implementation of a quantum illumination-like scheme was provided in Phys. Rev. Lett.101, 153603 (2013), where the enhancement was preserved despite the loss of nonclassicality. In the present paper, we investigate the source for quantum advantage in that realization. We introduce an effective two-mode description of the light sources and analyze the mutual information (MI) as a quantifier of total correlations in the effective two-mode picture. In the relevant regime of a highly thermalized background, we find that the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by the entangled sources over the unentangled thermal ones amounts exactly to the ratio of the effective MIs of the corresponding sources. More precisely, both quantities tend to a common limit specified by the squared ratio of the respective cross correlations. A thorough analysis of the experimental data confirms this theoretical result.},

@article{Roga2015,
	Abstract = {In quantum reading, a quantum state of light (transmitter) is applied to read classical information. In the presence of noise or for sufficiently weak signals, quantum reading can outperform classical reading by reason of enhanced state distinguishability. Here we show that enhanced quantum efficiency depends on the presence in the transmitter of a particular type of quantum correlations, the discord of response. Different encodings and transmitters give rise to different levels of efficiency. Considering noisy quantum probes, we show that squeezed thermal transmitters with non-symmetrically distributed noise among the field modes yield higher quantum efficiency compared with coherent thermal quantum states. The noise-enhanced quantum advantage is a consequence of the discord of response being a non-decreasing function of increasing thermal noise under constant squeezing, a behavior that leads to increased state distinguishability. We finally show that, for non-symmetric squeezed thermal states, the probability of error, as measured by the quantum Chernoff bound, vanishes asymptotically with increasing local thermal noise with finite global squeezing. Therefore, with fixed finite squeezing, noisy but strongly discordant quantum states with a large noise imbalance between the field modes can outperform noisy classical resources as well as pure entangled transmitters with the same finite level of squeezing.},

	Abstract = {The detection of weak magnetic fields with high spatial resolution is an important problem in diverse areas ranging from fundamental physics and material science to data storage and biomedical science. Here, we explore a novel approach to the detection of weak magnetic fields that takes advantage of recently developed techniques for the coherent control of solid-state electron spin quantum bits. Specifically, we investigate a magnetic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond. We discuss two important applications of this technique: a nanoscale magnetometer that could potentially detect precession of single nuclear spins and an optical magnetic-field imager combining spatial resolution ranging from micrometres to millimetres with a sensitivity approaching a few fT Hzâ1/2.},

The approach provides a clear insight into the interplay between decoherence and the extent of the prior knowledge in determining the optimal interrogation times and optimal estimation strategies. We propose a general framework capable of describing the local oscillator noise as well as additional atomic dephasing effects. We also demonstrate an important fact: the average Bayesian cost can be expressed explicitly using the quantum Fisher information and thus establish a direct link between the two, often competing, approaches to quantum estimation theory.},

	Abstract = {The Heisenberg limit traditionally provides a lower bound on the phase uncertainty scaling as 1/{\textless}N{\textgreater}, where {\textless}N{\textgreater} is the mean number of photons in the probe. However, this limit has a number of loopholes which potentially might be exploited, to achieve measurements with even greater accuracy. Here we close these loopholes by proving a completely rigorous form of the Heisenberg limit for the average error over all phase shifts. Our result gives the first completely general, constraint-free and non-asymptotic statement of the Heisenberg limit. It holds for all phase estimation schemes, including multiple passes, nonlinear phase shifts, multimode probes, and arbitrary measurements.},

@unpublished{pezze_non-classical_2016,
	Abstract = {Quantum technologies exploit entanglement to revolutionize computing, measurement, and communication. This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping, controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and illustrate successful theoretical proposals and experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.},

This scheme relies on a two-mode squeezed state, linear mixing, and a n-photon detection. It is optimally using expensive non-Gaussian resources to build up only the key non-Gaussian part of the targeted state. In the experimental case of a two-photon detection based on high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, the freely propagating state exhibits a 67\% fidelity with a squeezed even coherent-state superposition with a size {\textbar}Î±{\textbar}2=3. The demonstrated procedure and the achieved rate will facilitate the use of such superpositions in subsequent protocols, including fundamental tests and optical hybrid quantum information implementations.},

The scheme constitutes only a single beam splitter and a homodyne detector, and thus is experimentally feasible. In practice, a superposition of coherent states is transformed into a classical mixture of coherent states by linear loss, which is usually the dominant decoherence mechanism in optical systems. We also address the possibility of producing a larger amplitude superposition state from decohered states, and show that in most cases the decoherence of the states are amplified along with the amplitude.},

Weak squeezing on a single photon, beam mixing with an auxiliary coherent state, and photon detecting with imperfect threshold detectors are enough to generate a coherent state superposition in a free propagating optical field with a large coherent amplitude ({\^I}$\pm${\textgreater}2) and high fidelity (F{\textgreater}0.99). In contrast to all previous schemes to generate such a state, our scheme does not need photon number resolving measurements nor Kerr-type nonlinear interactions. Furthermore, it is robust to detection inefficiency and exhibits some resilience to photon production inefficiency.},

We thus report the experimental generation of a squeezed cat state from two single photon Fock states, which can be seen as cat states with zero amplitude. These Fock states are mixed on a symmetrical beam splitter, and the generation is heralded by a homodyne measurement in one of the two output arms. The output state has a fidelity of 61\% with an even squeezed cat state of amplitude Î±=1.63.

	Abstract = {We report on the experimental observation of quantum-network-compatible light described by a nonpositive Wigner function. The state is generated by photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum state produced by a continuous wave optical parametric amplifier. Ideally, the state is a coherent superposition of odd photon number states, closely resembling a superposition of weak coherent states {\textbar}Î±â©â{\textbar}âÎ±â©. In the limit of low squeezing the state is basically a single photon state. Light is generated with about 10 000 and more events per second in a nearly perfect spatial mode with a Fourier-limited frequency bandwidth which matches well atomic quantum memory requirements. The generated state of light is an excellent input state for testing quantum memories, quantum repeaters, and linear optics quantum computers.},

@article{vlastakis_deterministically_2013,
	Abstract = {Coherently Controlling Large Cats
The control and manipulation of quantum information based on superconducting circuits is an attractive route because of the possibility of scale-up. Vlastakis et al. (p. 607, published online 26 September; see the Perspective by Leek) were able to generate and control quantum entanglement between a superconducting qubit and hundreds of photons stored in a cavity resonator by using deterministic methods for on-demand generation of large Schr{\"o}dinger cat states in a microwave cavity with arbitrary size and phase. The ability to map the state of a qubit to large Schr{\"o}dinger cat states should provide a robust quantum resource in future quantum-based technologies.
In contrast to a single quantum bit, an oscillator can store multiple excitations and coherences provided one has the ability to generate and manipulate complex multiphoton states. We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons. With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states, known as a ``cat state.'' We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.
A scheme is demonstrated for coherently mapping the state of a single superconducting qubit onto a large number of photons. [Also see Perspective by Leek]

These codes exploit the noncommutative geometry of phase space to protect against errors that shift the values of the canonical variables q and p. In the setting of quantum optics, fault-tolerant universal quantum computation can be executed on the protected code subspace using linear optical operations, squeezing, homodyne detection, and photon counting; however, nonlinear mode coupling is required for the preparation of the encoded states. Finite-dimensional versions of these codes can be constructed that protect encoded quantum information against shifts in the amplitude or phase of a d-state system.

@article{deleglise_reconstruction_2008,
	Abstract = {The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description, from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum--classical boundary. Although trapped-atom state reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states, Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schr{\"o}dinger cat' states (superpositions of coherent states with different phases). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions. Quasi-classical coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schr{\"o}dinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations. We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schr{\"o}dinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities.},

	Abstract = {Microwave photons trapped in a superconducting cavity constitute an ideal system to realize some of the thought experiments imagined by the founding fathers of quantum physics. The interaction of these trapped photons with Rydberg atoms crossing the cavity illustrates fundamental aspects of measurement theory. The experiments performed with this ``photon box'' at Ecole Normale Sup{\'e}rieure (ENS) belong to the domain of quantum optics called ``cavity quantum electrodynamics.'' We have realized the nondestructive counting of photons, the recording of field quantum jumps, the preparation and reconstruction of ``Schr{\"o}dinger cat'' states of radiation and the study of their decoherence, which provides a striking illustration of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. These experiments have also led to the demonstration of basic steps in quantum information processing, including the deterministic entanglement of atoms and the realization of quantum gates using atoms and photons as quantum bits. This lecture starts by an introduction stressing the connection between the ENS photon box and the ion-trap experiments of David Wineland, whose accompanying lecture recalls his own contribution to the field of single particle control. I give then a personal account of the early days of cavity quantum electrodynamics before describing the main experiments performed at ENS during the last 20 years and concluding by a discussion comparing our work to other researches dealing with the control of single quantum particles.},

@article{yonezawa_quantum-enhanced_2012,
	Abstract = {Keeping Track of Photon Phase
In optical interferometers or optical communications, information is often stored in terms of the phase of the waveform or light pulse. However, fluctuations and noise can give rise to random jitter in the phase and amplitude of the optical pulses, making it difficult to keep track of the phase. Yonezawa et al. (p. 1514) developed a technique based on quantum mechanical squeezing to determine the phase of randomly varying optical waveforms. The quantum mechanical technique enhanced the precision with which the phase could be determined and, as optical technologies continue to be miniaturized, should be helpful in applications within metrology.
Tracking a randomly varying optical phase is a key task in metrology, with applications in optical communication. The best precision for optical-phase tracking has until now been limited by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of coherent light. Here, we surpass this coherent-state limit by using a continuous-wave beam in a phase-squeezed quantum state. Unlike in previous squeezing-enhanced metrology, restricted to phases with very small variation, the best tracking precision (for a fixed light intensity) is achieved for a finite degree of squeezing because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. By optimizing the squeezing, we track the phase with a mean square error 15 $\pm$ 4\% below the coherent-state limit.
A quantum mechanical technique is developed to enhance the phase tracking of photons.

	Abstract = {The introduction of control theory in quantum mechanics has created a rich, new interdisciplinary scientific field, which is producing novel insight into important theoretical questions at the heart of quantum physics. Exploring this emerging subject, Introduction to Quantum Control and Dynamics presents the mathematical concepts and fundamental physics behind the analysis and control of quantum dynamics, emphasizing the application of Lie algebra and Lie group theory.After introducing the basics of quantum mechanics, the book derives a class of models for quantum control systems from fundamental physics. It examines the controllability and observability of quantum systems and the related problem of quantum state determination and measurement. The author also uses Lie group decompositions as tools to analyze dynamics and to design control algorithms. In addition, he describes various other control methods and discusses topics in quantum information theory that include entanglement and entanglement dynamics. The final chapter covers the implementation of quantum control and dynamics in several fields.Armed with the basics of quantum control and dynamics, readers will invariably use this interdisciplinary knowledge in their mathematical, physics, and engineering work.},

In the standard weak-coupling limit derivation, this purely dissipative effect disappears if the frequencies are different because of the "ergodic average" used by this approach. However, there are physical situations where this technique is too rough to capture all the relevant aspects of the dissipative dynamics. In these cases, in order to better describe the physical behavior of the open system, it is necessary to go beyond the "ergodic average". We show that, in this more refined framework, the entanglement capability of the environment persists also in the case of different frequencies.},

We show that, for the wide class of teleportation-covariant channels in arbitrary dimension, including Pauli, erasure, and bosonic Gaussian channels, the quantum Fisher information cannot exceed an ultimate bound given by the Choi matrix of the encoding channel. In particular, we show that the adaptive estimation of the noise parameters of a teleportation-covariant channel cannot beat the standard quantum limit, therefore establishing a new intimate connection between teleportation and quantum metrology. We also extend our methods and results to quantum channel discrimination, finding a corresponding ultimate bound for the minimum error probability.},

	Abstract = {"Quantum sensing" describes the use of a quantum system, quantum properties or quantum phenomena to perform a measurement of a physical quantity. Historical examples of quantum sensors include magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices and atomic vapors, or atomic clocks. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities - especially with regard to high sensitivity - in applied physics and other areas of science. In this review, we provide an introduction to the basic principles, methods and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.},

	Abstract = {Entanglement is a resource central to quantum information (QI). In particular, entanglement shared between two distant parties allows them to do certain tasks that would otherwise be impossible. In this context, we study the effect on the available entanglement of physical restrictions on the local operations that can be performed by the two parties. We enforce these physical restrictions by generalized superselection rules (SSRs), which we define to be associated with a given group of physical transformations. Specifically the generalized SSR is that the local operations must be covariant with respect to that group. Then we operationally define the entanglement constrained by a SSR, and show that it may be far below that expected on the basis of a naive (or ``fluffy bunny'') calculation. We consider two examples. The first is a particle number SSR. Using this we show that for a two-mode BEC (with Alice owning mode \$A\$ and Bob mode \$B\$), the useful entanglement shared by Alice and Bob is identically zero. The second, a SSR associated with the symmetric group, is applicable to ensemble QI processing such as in liquid-NMR. We prove that even for an ensemble comprising many pairs of qubits, with each pair described by a pure Bell state, the entanglement per pair constrained by this SSR goes to zero for a large ensemble.},

Furthermore, we derive a tight upper bound, uniform for all states of a given dimension, on the variance of the surprisal, whose thermodynamic meaning is that of heat capacity.},

	abstract = {Thermally induced fluctuations impose a fundamental limit on precision measurement. In optical interferometry, the current bounds of stability and sensitivity are dictated by the excess mechanical damping of the high-reflectivity coatings that comprise the cavity end mirrors. Over the last decade, the dissipation of these amorphous multilayer reflectors has at best been reduced by a factor of two. Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm in optical coating technology based on direct-bonded monocrystalline multilayers, which exhibit both intrinsically low mechanical loss and high optical quality. Employing these âcrystalline coatingsâ as end mirrors in a FabryâPÃ©rot cavity, we obtain a finesse of 150,000. More importantly, at room temperature, we observe a thermally limited noise floor consistent with a tenfold reduction in mechanical damping when compared with the best dielectric multilayers. These results pave the way for the next generation of ultra-sensitive interferometers, as well as for new levels of laser stability.},

Thanks to the optical frequency comb technique, which established a coherent link between optical and radio frequencies, optical clocks have attracted increasing interest as regards future atomic clocks with superior precision. To date, single trapped ions and ultracold neutral atoms in free fall have shown record high performance that is approaching that of the best Cs fountain clocks. Here we report a different approach, in which atoms trapped in an optical lattice serve as quantum references. The 'optical lattice clock' demonstrates a linewidth one order of magnitude narrower than that observed for neutral-atom optical clocks, and its stability is better than that of single-ion clocks. The transition frequency for the Sr lattice clock is 429,228,004,229,952(15) Hz, as determined by an optical frequency comb referenced to the SI second.},

Here, we demonstrate optical lattice clocks with 87Sr atoms interrogated in a cryogenic environment to address the blackbody radiation-induced frequency shift, which remains the primary source of systematic uncertainty and has initiated vigorous theoretical and experimental investigations. The systematic uncertainty for the cryogenic clock is evaluated to be 7.2 Ã 10â18, which is expedited by operating two such cryo-clocks synchronously. After 11 measurements performed over a month, statistical agreement between the two cryo-clocks reached 2.0 Ã 10â18. Such clocks' reproducibility is a major step towards developing accurate clocks at the low 10â18 level, and is directly applicable as a means for relativistic geodesy.},

	abstract = {Tick, Tick, Tickâ¦
Many aspects of everyday life from communication to navigation rely on the precise ticking of the microwave transitions of the atoms in atomic clocks. Optical transitions occur at much higher frequency and so offer the opportunity to reduce the scale of the ticks even more. Hinkley et al. (p. 1215, published online 22 August; see the Perspective by Margolis) compare the ticking of two optical clocks and report an instability near the 10â18 level. Such performance will improve tests of general relativity and pave the way for a redefinition of the second.
Atomic clocks have been instrumental in science and technology, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advanced communications, and tests of fundamental constant variation. Timekeeping precision at 1 part in 1018 enables new timing applications in relativistic geodesy, enhanced Earth- and space-based navigation and telescopy, and new tests of physics beyond the standard model. Here, we describe the development and operation of two optical lattice clocks, both using spin-polarized, ultracold atomic ytterbium. A measurement comparing these systems demonstrates an unprecedented atomic clock instability of 1.6 Ã 10â18 after only 7 hours of averaging.

Although the galaxy does gradually join the expansion of the universe (Hubble flow), it does not necessarily recede from us. In particular, in the currently favored cosmological model, which includes a cosmological constant, the galaxy recedes from the observer as it joins the Hubble flow, but in the previously favored cold dark matter model, the galaxy approaches, passes through the observer, and joins the Hubble flow on the opposite side of the sky. We show that this behavior is consistent with the general relativistic idea that space is expanding and is determined by the acceleration of the expansion of the universe -- not a force or drag associated with the expansion itself. We also show that objects at a constant proper distance will have a nonzero redshift; receding galaxies can be blueshifted and approaching galaxies can be redshifted.},

With recent precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, large galaxy redshift surveys, better measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe and a host of other astrophysical observations, there is now a standard, highly constrained cosmological model. It is not a cosmology that was predicted. Unidentified dark particles dominate the matter content of our Universe, and mysteries surround the processes responsible for the accelerated expansion at its earliest moments (inflation?) and for its recent acceleration (dark energy?). New measurements must address the fundamental questions: what happened at the birth of the Universe, and what is its ultimate fate?},

	abstract = {From the analysis of all available radiometric measurements of distances between the Earth and the major planets (including observations of martian landers and orbiters over 1971â2003 with the errors of few meters) the positive secular trend in the Astronomical Unit AU is estimated as ddtAU=15Â±4m/cyddtAU=15Â±4m/cy\{\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}{\textbackslash}over\{\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}t\}\} \{{\textbackslash}rm AU\} = 15 {\textbackslash}pm 4 \{{\textbackslash}rm m/cy\} . The given uncertainty is the 10 times enlarged formal error of the least-squares estimate and so accounts for possible systematic errors of measurements and deficiencies of the mathematical model. The reliability of this estimate as well as its physical meaning are discussed. A priori most plausible attribution of this effect to the cosmological expansion of the Universe turns out inadequate. A model of the observables developed in the frame of the relativistic background metric of the uniform isotropic Universe shows that the corresponding dynamical perturbations in the major planet motions are completely canceled out by the Einstein effect of dependence of the rate of the observerâs clock (that keeps the proper time) on the gravitational field, though separately values of these two effects are quite large and attainable with the accuracy achieved. Another tentative source of the secular rate of AU is the loss of the solar mass due to the solar wind and electromagnetic radiation but it amounts in ddtAUddtAU\{\{{\textbackslash}rm d\} {\textbackslash}over \{\{{\textbackslash}rm d\} t\}\} \{{\textbackslash}rm AU\} only to 0.3 m/cy. Excluding other explanations that seem exotic (such as secular decrease of the gravitational constant) at present there is no satisfactory explanation of the detected secular increase of AU, at least in the frame of the considered uniform models of the Universe.},

We first explain the basic elements of entanglement theory for two or more particles and then entanglement verification procedures such as Bell inequalities, entanglement witnesses, the determination of nonlinear properties of a quantum state via measurements on several copies, and spin squeezing inequalities. An emphasis is given to the theory and application of entanglement witnesses. We also discuss several experiments, where some of the presented methods have been implemented. "

According to quantum mechanics, a vacuum is not empty space. A consequence of the uncertainly principle is that particles or energy can come into existence for a fleeting moment. Such vacuum or quantum fluctuations are known to exist, but evidence for them has been indirect. Riek et al. present an ultrafast optical based technique that probes the vacuum fluctuation of electromagnetic radiation directly.
Science, this issue p. 420
The ground state of quantum systems is characterized by zero-point motion. This motion, in the form of vacuum fluctuations, is generally considered to be an elusive phenomenon that manifests itself only indirectly. Here, we report direct detection of the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in free space. The ground-state electric-field variance is inversely proportional to the four-dimensional space-time volume, which we sampled electro-optically with tightly focused laser pulses lasting a few femtoseconds. Subcycle temporal readout and nonlinear coupling far from resonance provide signals from purely virtual photons without amplification. Our findings enable an extreme time-domain approach to quantum physics, with nondestructive access to the quantum state of light. Operating at multiterahertz frequencies, such techniques might also allow time-resolved studies of intrinsic fluctuations of elementary excitations in condensed matter.
Ultrafast optics can directly probe the electric-field vacuum fluctuations.

The gravitational field of a beam of light in the short wavelength approximation has been studied by several authors.

Then, novel features of the gravitational field of a laser beam become apparent, such as frame-dragging due to its spin angular momentum and the deflection of parallel co-propagating test beams that overlap with the source beam. Even though the effects are too small to be detected with current technology, they are of conceptual interest, revealing the gravitational properties of light.},

	abstract = {The effect of gravity and proper acceleration on the frequency spectrum of an optical resonator—both rigid or deformable—is considered in the framework of general relativity. The optical resonator is modeled either as a rod of matter connecting two mirrors or as a dielectric rod whose ends function as mirrors. Explicit expressions for the frequency spectrum are derived for the case that it is only perturbed slightly and variations are slow enough to avoid any elastic resonances of the rod. For a deformable resonator, the perturbation of the frequency spectrum depends on the speed of sound in the rod supporting the mirrors. A connection is found to a relativistic concept of rigidity when the speed of sound approaches the speed of light. In contrast, the corresponding result for the assumption of Born rigidity is recovered when the speed of sound becomes infinite. The results presented in this article can be used as the basis for the description of optical and opto-mechanical systems in a curved spacetime. We apply our results to the examples of a uniformly accelerating resonator and an optical resonator in the gravitational field of a small moving sphere. To exemplify the applicability of our approach beyond the framework of linearized gravity, we consider the fictitious situation of an optical resonator falling into a black hole.},

Furthermore, our result proves that the employed combination of a bright coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state is generally the optimum practical approach for phase estimation with high precision on absolute scales. Based on our analysis we conclude that the application of neither Fock states nor NOON states nor any other sophisticated nonclassical quantum state would have yielded an appreciably higher quantum-noise-limited sensitivity.},

Photon shot noise, due to the quantum nature of light, imposes a fundamental limit on the attometre-level sensitivity of the kilometre-scale Michelson interferometers deployed for this task. Here, we inject squeezed states to improve the performance of one of the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) beyond the quantum noise limit, most notably in the frequency region down to 150 Hz, critically important for several astrophysical sources, with no deterioration of performance observed at any frequency. With the injection of squeezed states, this LIGO detector demonstrated the best broadband sensitivity to gravitational waves ever achieved, with important implications for observing the gravitational-wave Universe with unprecedented sensitivity.

After introducing the subject material and outlining the essential toolbox of continuous variable systems, we define the basic notions needed to understand Gaussian states and Gaussian operations. In particular, emphasis is placed on the mathematical structure combining notions of algebra and symplectic geometry fundamental to a complete understanding of Gaussian informatics. Furthermore, we discuss the quantification of different forms of correlations (including entanglement and quantum discord) for Gaussian states, paying special attention to recently developed measures. The paper is concluded by succinctly expressing the main Gaussian state limitations and outlining a selection of possible future lines for quantum information processing with continuous variable systems.},

We first address the ultimate bounds to precision by discussing the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information. We then consider photodetection at the output and calculate the sensitivity of the interferometers taking into account the non unit quantum efficiency of the detectors. Our results show that in the ideal case of photon number detectors with unit quantum efficiency the best configuration is the symmetric one, namely, passive (active) interferometer with passive (active) detection stage: in this case one may achieve Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity by suitably optimizing over Gaussian states at the input. On the other hand, in the realistic case of detectors with non unit quantum efficiency, the performances of passive scheme are unavoidably degraded, whereas detectors involving optical parametric amplifiers allow to fully compensate the presence of loss in the detection stage, thus restoring the Heisenberg scaling.},

Using the covariance matrix formalism, we derive the quantum Fisher information of this active interferometer with a general two-mode Gaussian unitary channel, as well as the sensitivity for a number-sum measurement scheme, finding simple expressions for the latter.

	abstract = {Quantum states of light, such as squeezed states or entangled states, can be used to make measurements (metrology), produce images, and sense objects with a precision that far exceeds what is possible classically, and also exceeds what was once thought to be possible quantum mechanically. The primary idea is to exploit quantum effects to beat the shot-noise limit in metrology and the Rayleigh diffraction limit in imaging and sensing. Quantum optical metrology has received a boost in recent years with an influx of ideas from the rapidly evolving field of optical quantum information processing. Both areas of research exploit the creation and manipulation of quantum-entangled states of light. We will review some of the recent theoretical and experimental advances in this exciting new field of quantum optical metrology, focusing on examples that exploit a particular two-mode entangled photon state – the High-N00N state.},

So far, research has concentrated almost exclusively on quantum-enhancements in integrable systems, such as precessing spins or harmonic oscillators prepared in non-classical states. Here we show that large benefits can be drawn from rendering integrable quantum sensors chaotic, both in terms of achievable sensitivity as well as robustness to noise, while avoiding the challenge of preparing and protecting large-scale entanglement. We apply the method to spin-precession magnetometry and show in particular that the sensitivity of state-of-the-art magnetometers can be further enhanced by subjecting the spin-precession to non-linear kicks that renders the dynamics chaotic.},

	abstract = {Recently proposed quantum-chaotic sensors achieve quantum enhancements in measurement precision by applying nonlinear control pulses to the dynamics of the quantum sensor while us- ing classical initial states that are easy to prepare. Here, we use the cross entropy method of reinforcement learning to optimize the strength and position of control pulses. Compared to the quantum-chaotic sensors in the presence of superradiant damping, we find that decoherence can be fought even better and measurement precision can be enhanced further by optimizing the control. In some examples, we find enhancements in sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude. By visualizing the evolution of the quantum state, the mechanism exploited by the reinforcement learn- ing method is identified as a kind of spin-squeezing strategy that is adapted to the superradiant damping.},

	abstract = {A long optical path has been folded between two 7.5-cm diam spherical or aspherical mirrors to provide an output beam which can be well separated from previous reflections with 1000 or more passes between the mirrors. The 3000-m path provides 10 psec of delay. This system can be used as a dispersionless optical delay line for use in filtering or storage of information modulated onto the light beam. The pat- tern of beams between the two mirrors is obtained in one of two ways. A small perturbing mirror may be inserted to give a series of offset ellipses, or one or both of the mirrors can be made astigmatic to give a Lissajous pattern of spots on each mirror. The output beam can be separated from others by dis- criminating in both angle and position. The diffraction losses of the system are much lower than those for an open beam because of the periodic focusing of the spherical mirrors. The extreme dependence of the loss of the delay line upon the absorption and scattering loss of the mirrors makes the system de- pendent upon very low loss mirrors and also makes the system a suitable method for measuring mirror loss. Block diagrams are shown for some possible filtering and storage applications.},

The dynamics of the device is modeled as a kicked nonlinear system. The pulsed parametric amplifier constitutes the kick. In between kicks the dynamics is determined by the Kerr nonlinearity and damping. In the absence of damping, a classical description of the device exhibits a rich phase-space structure including fixed points of multiple period and chaos. We contrast the classi- cal behavior of the mean intensity with that predicted by quantum dynamics. The mean photon number inside the cavity is shown to undergo regular collapse and revival in the regular region of the phase space and irregular revivals in the chaotic region. When damping is included, the quantum recurrences are rapidly suppressed, and the classical behavior is restored. In this case a stable steady state is possi- ble. The damping represents the effect of photon-number measurements on the system. We also discuss the photon statistics in the steady state.},

	title = {Statistical Dynamics of Quantum Oscillators and Parametric Amplification in a Single Mode},
	url = {https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.2.1541},
	abstract = {The description of the statistical dynamics of quantum oscillators is formulated in terms
of the Wigner distribution, analogous to the more commonly used P distribution, with ex- plicit formulas being obtained for its time evolution and for average values. This formula- tion is desirable because, e.g. , the Wigner distribution always exists whereas the P distribu- tion does not. The formalism is applied to the process of parametric amplification in a single mode, which may be considered as the degenerate form of the well-known two-mode case. This degeneracy gives rise to significantly different properties; for example, the P distribu- tion for the single mode of interest evolves from a circularly symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian into an elliptically symmetric form and ceases to exist after a finite time, even for amplification in the presence of losses. This is contrary to the two-mode case. The cor- responding Wigner distribution is found to exist as a well-behaved function for aO time as ex- pected, regardless of the amount of losses, and is used to calculate average values of various quantities of interest. It is found, e.g. , that. in the lossless case the average number of photons in the signal mode always becomes infinite as t-~. This is in contrast to the cor- responding classical result for the lossless case which allows the signal to decay rather
than to grow with time, depending on the relative phase between the signal and the pump.
Field fluctuations are discussed and found to have some unusual properties. The combina- tion of frequency up-conversion with single-mode amplification is also described briefly.
The effect of the quantization of the pump oscillator is considered in an Appendix.},

We assume that the unitary part of the dynamics is represented by Gaussian operations which preserve the Gaussian nature of the quantum state, i.e. arbitrary phase rotations, bounded squeezing and unlimited displacements. In the ideal ansatz of unconstrained quantum control (i.e. when the unitary phase rotations, squeezing and displacement of the mode can be performed instantaneously), we study how control can be optimized for speeding up the relaxation towards the fixed point of the dynamics and we analytically derive the optimal relaxation time.

Different sets of physically relevant initial configurations are considered, including one- and two-mode Gaussian states, number states, and coherent superpositions.

In the electromagnetic case, we show that the quantization of electromagnetic radiation (which causes decoherence of Alice’s particle) and vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (which limits Bob’s ability to localize his particle to better than a charge-radius), both are essential for avoiding apparent paradoxes with causality and complementarity. We then analyze the gravitational version of this Gedankenexperiment. We correct an error in the analysis of Mari et al. [Sci. Rep. 6, 22777 (2016).] and of Baym and Ozawa [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 3035 (2009).], who did not properly account for the conservation of center of mass of an isolated system. We show that the analysis of the gravitational case is in complete parallel with the electromagnetic case, provided that gravitational radiation is quantized and that vacuum fluctuations limit the localization of a particle to no better than a Planck length. This provides support for the view that (linearized) gravity should have a quantum field description.},

By periodically modulating the source mass position at a frequency f=12.7mHz we generate a time-dependent gravitational acceleration at the location of the test mass, which is measured off resonance in a miniature torsional balance configuration. Over an integration time of 350 hours the test mass oscillator enables measurements with a systematic accuracy of 4E-11m/s{\textasciicircum}2 and a statistical precision of 4E-12m/s{\textasciicircum}2. This is sufficient to resolve the gravitational signal at a minimal surface distance of 400mum between the two masses. We observe both linear and quadratic coupling, consistent in signal strength with a time-varying 1/r gravitational potential. Contributions of non-gravitational forces could be kept to less than 10\% of the observed signal. We expect further improvements to enable the isolation of gravity as a coupling force for objects well below the Planck mass. This opens the way for precision tests of gravity in a new regime of isolated microscopic source masses.},

	abstract = {Measuring tiny forces with atomic clouds
For projects such as detecting gravity waves, physicists need to measure tiny forces precisely. Schreppler et al. developed an extremely sensitive method for force measurement. They applied a known force on a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical cavity. The force caused the atoms to oscillate, and the researchers used optical measurements to monitor the motion. Under optimal conditions, the authors could measure forces with a level of sensitivity only four times worse than the fundamental limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Science, this issue p. 1486
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the noise in a force measurement based on continuously detecting a mechanical oscillator’s position. This bound, the standard quantum limit, can be reached when the oscillator subjected to the force is unperturbed by its environment and when measurement imprecision from photon shot noise is balanced against disturbance from measurement back-action. We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically. When the driving force is resonant with the cloud’s oscillation frequency, we achieve a sensitivity that is a factor of 4 above the standard quantum limit and consistent with theoretical predictions given the atoms’ residual thermal disturbance and the photodetection quantum efficiency.
A very sensitive force-measuring technique uses ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical cavity as a mechanical oscillator.

Test rays moving parallel to the pencil or pulse do so with uniform unit velocity the same as that in the pencil or pulse itself. Test rays moving in other directions experience a gravitational action. A test particle placed at a point equally distant from the two ends of a pencil experiences no acceleration parallel to the pencil, but is accelerated towards the pencil by twice the amount which would be calculated from a simple application of the Newtonian theory. The result is satisfactory from the point of view of the conservation of momentum. A test particle placed at a point equally distant from the two ends of the track of a pulse experiences no net integrated acceleration parallel to the track, but experiences a net acceleration towards the track which is satisfactory from the point of view of the conservation of momentum.},

Here, we use a near-concentric cavity to focus 7.5 kW of continuous-wave circulating laser power at 1064 nm into a 7 \&\#x000B5;m mode waist, achieving a record continuous laser intensity of 40 GW/cm2.

Under suitable conditions, and even in the presence of detuning between the natural precession frequencies of the two spins, they are shown to reach a long-lasting transient behavior where they oscillate in phase. We explore the connection between the emergence of such a behavior and the establishment of robust quantum correlations between the two spins, analyzing differences between dissipative and dephasing effects. In particular, in the regime in which synchronization occurs, quantum correlations are more robust for shorter synchronization times and this is related to a separation between system decay rates.},

	abstract = {A common environment acting on two superconducting qubits can give rise to a plethora of phenomena, such as the generation of entanglement between the qubits that, beyond its importance for quantum computation tasks, also enforces a change of strategy in quantum error correction protocols. Further effects induced by a common bath are quantum synchronization and subradiance. Contrary to entanglement, for which full-state tomography is necessary, the latter can be assessed by detection of local observables only. In this work we explore different regimes to establish when synchronization and subradiance can be employed as reliable signatures of an entangling common bath. Moreover, we address a recently proposed measure of the collectiveness of the dynamics driven by the bath, and find that it almost perfectly witnesses the behavior of entanglement. Finally, we propose an implementation of the model based on two transmon qubits capacitively coupled to a common resistor, which may be employed as a versatile quantum simulation platform of the open system in general regimes.},

	abstract = {The transverse coherent motion of the two colliding LHC beams is studied by multiparticle tracking, where the beam-beam force is calculated assuming a Gaussian beam distribution with variable barycentres and rms beam sizes. The simulation yields the coherent and incoherent oscillation frequencies, the emittance growth of either beam, and evidence for the existence or lack of Landau damping. The transverse beam sizes change with the fractional part of the tune as expected from the dynamic beta eﬀect. For head-on collisions, we ﬁnd that the π-mode frequency lies outside of the continuum frequency spread if the ratio of the beam-beam parameters exceeds 0.6, in accordance with predictions [1]. For smaller ratios, the π-mode is Landau damped. When long range interactions are also included, undamped coherent modes do still exist outside the continuum, both with and without alternating crossing planes at two interaction points. However, the simulation shows that separating the tunes of the two beams can restore the Landau damping.},

It is well known that the head-on collision of two beams of equal strength can excite coherent modes whose frequencies are separated from the incoherent spectrum of oscillations of individual particles. This can lead to the loss of Landau damping and possibly to unstable motion. The beam-beam effect in the LHC is further complicated by a large number of bunches (2808 per beam), a ﬁnite crossing angle and gaps in the bunch train. The coherent beam-beam effects under various conditions and operational scenarios are studied analytically and with multiparticle simulations.

Transition from the weak-strong to the strong-strong cases is found at the intensity ratio of about 60\% when a discrete p-mode frequency emerges from continuum of eigenfrequencies related to the beam-beam tunespread in the weaker bunch. In the strong-strong case the large coherent beam-beam tuneshift dominates over interchange processes between coherent and incoherent motion; it can switch off Landau damping of dipole transverse oscillations, slows down incoherent emittance growth due to external kicks on the beams.

The synchrotron radiation emitted from such beams is feeble; even in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operating with 7 TeV protons, the longitudinal damping time is about 13 hours. None of the traditional cooling methods seem able to cool LHC-class protons beams. In this Letter, we present a novel method of coherent electron cooling based on a high-gain free-electron laser (FEL). This technique could be critical for reaching high luminosities in hadron and electron-hadron colliders.},

	abstract = {The existing CERN accelerator infrastructure is world unique and its research capacity should be fully exploited. In the coming decade its principal modus operandi will be focused on producing intense proton beams, accelerating and colliding them at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with the highest achievable luminosity. This activity should, in our view, be complemented by new initiatives and their feasibility studies targeted on re-using the existing CERN accelerator complex in novel ways that were not conceived when the machines were designed. They should provide attractive, ready-to-implement research options for the forthcoming paradigm-shift phase of the CERN research. This paper presents one of the case studies of the Gamma Factory initiative (Krasny, 2015) – a proposal of a new operation scheme of ion beams in the CERN accelerator complex. Its goal is to extend the scope and precision of the LHC-based research by complementing the proton–proton collision programme with the high-luminosity nucleus–nucleus one. Its numerous physics highlights include studies of the exclusive Higgs-boson production in photon–photon collisions and precision measurements of the electroweak (EW) parameters. There are two principal ways to increase the LHC luminosity which do not require an upgrade of the CERN injectors: (1) modification of the beam-collision optics and (2) reduction of the transverse emittance of the colliding beams. The former scheme is employed by the ongoing high-luminosity (HL-LHC) project. The latter one, applicable only to ion beams, is proposed in this paper. It is based on laser cooling of bunches of partially stripped ions at the SPS flat-top energy. For isoscalar calcium beams, which fulfil the present beam-operation constrains and which are particularly attractive for the EW physics, the transverse beam emittance can be reduced by a factor of 5 within the 8 seconds long cooling phase. The predicted nucleon–nucleon luminosity of LNN=4.2×1034s−1cm−2 for collisions of the cooled calcium beams at the LHC top energy is comparable to the levelled luminosity for the HL-LHC proton–proton collisions, but with reduced pile-up background. The scheme proposed in this paper, if confirmed by the future Gamma Factory proof-of-principle experiment, could be implemented at CERN with minor infrastructure investments.},

The usual heating due to intra-beam collisions should completely vanish, giving rise to a state of unprecedented brilliance. Despite a continuous improvement of beam cooling techniques, such as electron cooling and laser cooling, the ultimate goal5 of beam crystallization has not yet been reached in high-energy storage rings. Electron-cooled dilute beams of highly charged ions show liquid-like order6,7 with unique applications8. An experiment5 using laser cooling9,10 suggested a reduction of intra-beam heating, although the results were ambiguous. Here we demonstrate the crystallization of laser-cooled Mg+ beams circulating in the radiofrequency quadrupole storage ring PALLAS11,12 at a velocity of 2,800 m s-1, which corresponds to a beam energy of 1 eV. A sudden collapse of the transverse beam size and the low longitudinal velocity spread clearly indicate the phase transition. The continuous ring-shaped crystalline beam shows exceptional stability, surviving for more than 3,000 revolutions without cooling.},

	abstract = {The renewed serious interest to possible practical applications of gravitational waves is encouraging. Building on previous work, I am arguing that the strong variable electromagnetic fields are appropriate systems for the generation and detection of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The advantages of electromagnetic systems are clearly seen in the proposed complete laboratory experiment, where one has to ensure the efficiency of, both, the process of generation and the process of detection of HFGW. Within the family of electromagnetic systems, one still has a great variety of possible geometrical configurations, classical and quantum states of the electromagnetic field, detection strategies, etc. According to evaluations performed 30 years ago, the gap between the HFGW laboratory signal and its level of detectability is at least 4 orders of magnitude. Hopefully, new technologies of today can remove this gap and can make the laboratory experiment feasible. The laboratory experiment is bound to be expensive, but one should remember that a part of the cost is likely to be reimbursed from the Nobel prize money ! Electromagnetic systems seem also appropriate for the detection of high-frequency end of the spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Although the current effort to observe the stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is focused on the opposite, very low-frequency, end of the spectrum, it would be extremely valuable for fundamental science to detect, or put sensible upper limits on, the high-frequency relic gravitational waves. I will briefly discuss the origin of relic gravitational waves, the expected level of their high-frequency signal, and the existing estimates of its detectability.},

	abstract = {A successful experiment combining emission and reception of gravitational waves (GWs) would constitute a premiere of gravity control. However, such experiments manipulating gravity would require to compactly store large amounts of energy while using ultra-sensitive detection techniques and hence can be expected to be very difficult to realise. In this paper, we first propose new designs of electromagnetic (EM) generators allowing directional emission of GWs. They are based on the resonant amplification of GWs occuring when EM standing waves couple to an external static magnetic field. The interplay between the EM polarizations, the orientation of the boosting magnetic field and the emitted GW polarizations is studied, as well as the gravitational radiation patterns of the different generators. Then, we develop a new GW directional detection method based on magnetic energy storage. Three possible applications are presented: (i) indirect detection of GW emission by high-accuracy monitoring of the energy loss in the generators ; (ii) direct detection of an incoming plane GW with a high-field magnet and (iii) GW emission-reception experiments. Although current technology allows reaching detection thresholds in these experiments, their practical realisation would still need to overcome several key technical challenges.},

The interaction of the gravitational wave with the cavity walls, and the resulting motion, induces the transition of some electromagnetic energy from an initially excited cavity mode to an empty one. The energy transfer is maximum when the frequency of the wave is equal to the frequency difference of the two cavity modes. In this paper, some ideas for the development of a tunable detector of gravitational waves around 10 kHz are discussed; the outline of a possible detector design and its expected sensitivity are also shown.},

Moreover, the vibration amplitude must be measured over and over again without perturbing it (quantum nondemolition measurement). This contrasts with quantum chemistry, quantum optics, or atomic, nuclear, and elementary particle physics, where one usually makes measurements on an ensemble of identical objects and does not care whether any single object is perturbed or destroyed by the measurement. This article describes the new electronic techniques required for quantum nondemolition measurements and the theory underlying them.

This is achieved with a suitably engineered coupling to a dissipative cold reservoir usually formed by an electromagnetic mode. In the field of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the electromagnetic cavity naturally serves as a cold reservoir for the mechanical mode. Here, we realize the opposite scenario and engineer a mechanical oscillator cooled close to its ground state into a cold dissipative reservoir for microwave photons in a superconducting circuit. By tuning the coupling to this dissipative mechanical reservoir, we demonstrate dynamical backaction control of the microwave field, leading to stimulated emission and maser action. Moreover, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum resource, allowing the implementation of a near-quantum-limited phase-preserving microwave amplifier. Such engineered mechanical dissipation extends the toolbox of quantum manipulation techniques of the microwave field and constitutes a new ingredient for optomechanical protocols.},

We show that there is a steplike crossover to a synchronized state as a function of the driving strength. In contrast to the classical case, there is a finite threshold value in driving. Quantum noise reduces the synchronized region and leads to a deviation from strict frequency locking.},

	abstract = {The entropy of a quantum operation, defined as the von Neumann entropy of the corresponding Choi–Jamiołkowski state, characterizes the coupling of the principal system with the environment. For any quantum channel acting on a state of a given size, one defines the complementary channel, which sends the input state into the state of the environment after the operation. Making use of subadditivity of entropy, we show that for any dimension the sum of both entropies is bounded from below. This result characterizes the trade-off between the information on the initial quantum state accessible to the principal system and the information leaking to the environment. For one qubit maps we describe the interpolating family of depolarizing maps, for which the sum of both entropies gives the lower boundary of the region allowed in the space spanned by both entropies.},
